# Evaluating Oxigraph Server as a triple store for small and medium-sized datasets

This repository contains the [code](./code/README.md) and [preprint](./paper/paper.md) for the [DBCLS BioHackathon 2023](https://2023.biohackathon.org) project titled "Evaluating Oxigraph Server as a Triple Store for Small and Medium-Sized Datasets".

The evaluation focused on the use of [Oxigraph](https://oxigraph.org), a modern graph database implemented in the Rust programming language, as a triple store for handling small to medium-sized (sub-billion) datasets in the context of RDF and SPARQL technologies.
